# Python Functions
Functions are like mini-programs that complete a specific task.

 
### ðŸ”§ Basic Syntax
    def name_of_function(params):
        #Body of the function

## ðŸ§® Function
A function is:

    1. Like mini-programs that complete a specific task.
    2. Any function must be define or imported before call in the program.
    3. A variable created inside a function is a **local** variable and can only be used inside that function.
    4. A variable created in main body of the program is a **global** variable and has global scope. That means it can be used anywhere including function. However it's not recommended to use the global variable inside function, instead of that pass as a parameter of function.
    5. Used to organize your code by logical units.
    6. Used for code reusability, means to reuse a chunk of code over and over.

### âœ… Example:
   def greeting(name):
        print("Hello",name)
