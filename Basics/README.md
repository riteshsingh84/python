Repository to store sample python programs for python learning.

This repository is meant for beginners to assist them in their learning of Python. The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.

If this is your first time coding in Python, I would love to suggest you begin from the Basics. They are simple to understand and hopefully will you enjoy step by step learning.

### 🧱 Basics
* Variables and data types (int, float, str, bool, None)
* Comments (# single-line, '''multi-line''')
* Type conversion (int(), str(), float(), bool())

### 🔁 Control Flow
* if, elif, else
* for and while loops
* break, continue, pass

### 📦 Data Structures
* List: creation, indexing, slicing, methods (append, pop, sort)
* Tuple: immutable sequences
* Set: unique items, set operations
* Dict: key-value pairs, methods (get, items, keys, values)

### 🧠 Comprehensions
* List, Set, and Dictionary comprehensions

### 🧰 Functions
* Defining functions with def
* Parameters and return values
* Lambda functions

### 🧪 Built-in Functions
* len(), type(), range(), enumerate(), zip(), map(), filter(), sum(), min(), max()

### 📁 Modules and Imports
* import math, from module import function
* Common modules: math, random, datetime, os, sys

### 📄 File Handling
* open(), read(), write(), with open() as

### ❗ Error Handling
* try, except, finally, raise

### 🧪 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
* Classes and objects
* __init__ method
* Inheritance
* self keyword

### 🧪 Advanced Topics (Optional)
* Decorators
* Generators (yield)
* List vs. shallow vs. deep copy
* Virtual environments (venv)

Contributions to the repository are welcome.
